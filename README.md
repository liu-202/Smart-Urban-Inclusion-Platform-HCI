# Smart Urban Inclusion Platform (HCI Assignment 2)

This repository provides a conceptual and beta-level implementation to support
the Smart Urban Inclusion Platform proposed in HCI Assignment 2.

## Beta Version Prototype (Criteria 9)
To fulfill Criteria 9, one key function with both visual and audio features was
selected and implemented as a beta version prototype. The selected function is
the AI Voice Assistant feature.

The beta prototype demonstrates voice-based user interaction combined with
visual feedback on the user interface. Speech input is processed using a speech
recognition API, and system responses are delivered through both visual UI
updates and audio feedback using text-to-speech functionality.

## Scope
This repository focuses on demonstrating the feasibility of visual and audio
interaction rather than full system deployment. The implementation is intended
for academic demonstration purposes only.
